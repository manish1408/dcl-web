JavaScript is dynamic by nature. This means you can change the values of various data types, which makes it very versatile. Dart is both dynamic and static, which allows it to have the best of both worlds.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"A statically typed language is generally considered much safer since it forces you to declare and use the correct data type. For example, you can’t assign a number to a string; doing so would throw an error.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Static means you’re likely to experience fewer errors. It is possible to enforce more type safety and error checking with JavaScript if you opt to use TypeScript, which is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, instead.","spans":[]},{"type":"heading3","text":"Layout","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Flutter uses a widget style for constructing the user interface whereas React Native uses JavaScript and JSX. Flutter widgets are premade, so you don’t technically need to create your own custom widgets unless you want to. Since they were created and tested by Google, you don’t need to worry about incompatibility issues.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"One thing I should mention is that if you’re using a programming language such as Swift for mobile app development, you typically can’t see the code that Apple used to create user interface components, such as buttons. With Flutter, by contrast, the code is viewable so you can see how Google created all the widgets.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Flutter and React Native share common ground when it comes to constructing the layout in that they both use CSS Flexbox. The way they implement it is different, but as long as you know Flexbox, you shouldn’t have any problems building the layout for your app. The team that worked on Flutter also worked on the developer tools for the Google Chrome browser, which makes for a quick transition since the debug tools are quite similar.","spans":[{"start":108,"end":119,"type":"hyperlink","data":{"link_type":"Web","url":"https://blog.logrocket.com/flexbox-vs-css-grid/"}}]},{"type":"heading2","text":"Why is mobile app development so popular?","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"The field of mobile app development has grown steadily over the past few years. Almost everyone on the planet has a mobile phone, so the user base is massive. These days, you can find an app for almost anything.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"There are quite a few paths you can take if you want to create a mobile app. You could choose to go down the native route, which would mean using Swift to create mobile apps or Kotlin to create Android apps. These are the official programming languages Apple and Google use, respectively, so you can expect first-party support and frequent updates.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Alternatively, you could choose to go down the cross-platform path and use Flutter or React Native. Typically, a native developer would use Xcode and Swift to build iOS apps and Android Studio and Kotlin for Android apps. These tools are applicable for cross-platform work. It’s also quite common for developers to use an integrated development environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio Code.","spans":[{"start":371,"end":389,"type":"hyperlink","data":{"link_type":"Web","url":"https://blog.logrocket.com/top-10-vs-code-extensions-2021/"}}]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"In most cases, developers tend to use an IDE, Android Studio, or Xcode when building apps with Flutter and React Native. My preference is to use Visual Studio Code for React Native apps and Android Studio for Flutter apps. Android Studio actually has a Flutter plugin with code helpers, which makes it much easier to write and debug your code. As of right now, this plugin has 8.3 million downloads, which goes to show just how popular it is.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"At the time of writing, React Native is slightly more popular than Flutter, thanks in part to React Native’s association with the popular web framework React. React Native has also been around for longer so its user base is larger. As such, there is currently higher demand for React Native developers than for Flutter developers.","spans":[]},{"type":"heading2","text":"Flutter vs. React Native: Performance","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Both Flutter and React are open-source, which means they’re free to use. Both libraries are well-maintained, as you would expect considering they’re created by Google and Facebook. It is possible to test apps created using both frameworks, either virtually using a built-in simulator on your computer for iOS and Android or natively on your phone. You’ll need an Apple computer if you intend to develop on iOS since the SDK is only available on Apple computers. Windows users and Linux users are out of luck. Fortunately, you can develop Android development apps on any platform.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Both frameworks use hot reloading so you can make changes and see them instantly. This makes development more efficient because you don’t have to keep stopping and starting your apps to see updates.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"There is some debate as to whether Flutter and React Native are truly native. The be considered 100 percent native, they would need to be written in the language they were designed for — namely, Swift for iOS and Kotlin/Java for Android.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"The experience you get when using an app that was written in React Native and Flutter is, for the most part, a native experience. The Dart code, which Flutter uses, is complied to C, which is about as close to native as you can expect. You can safely assume that would make for better performance.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"The company that created Reflectly recently moved the app from React Native to Flutter and saw a significant increase in performance.
